## Conclusion: Practicing Integrity in the Age of AI

As AI continues to become more integrated into academic life, you must adapt with equal parts curiosity and responsibility. Ethical AI use isn’t just about avoiding misconduct, it’s about preserving the integrity of your learning and taking ownership of your educational journey.

By understanding where and how AI can enhance your work, and recognizing when its use crosses ethical lines, you set yourself up for success not only in your courses, but in your future career. Let AI be your assistant, not your substitute.

Remember:

Use AI to explore ideas, not to do your thinking for you.

Stay informed about your university's policies.

Prompt clearly, check sources, and engage critically.

Protect your data and avoid reinforcing bias.

Treat AI as a powerful tool — and wield it wisely.
