# Ethical AI Use: A User Guide
AI tools have become increasingly common in university settings. Students now have access to models that can assist with writing, research, problem-solving, and more. When used thoughtfully, these tools can enhance the learning processes. However, responsible use requires intention, honesty, and awareness.

AI should support learning, not replace it. We benefit most when we use AI to generate ideas, clarify confusing topics, or review and improve our work. Delegating entire assignments to AI undermines the purpose of education and can lead to academic integrity violations.

Many universities now maintain policies that govern the use of AI in coursework. These policies vary across departments and institutions but generally aim to preserve the integrity of student learning. Becoming familiar with these guidelines and following them closely will help you avoid unintentional misuse.

This guide outlines practical and ethical ways to integrate AI tools into your academic work. The goal is to help you benefit from what these technologies offer without sacrificing the skills and critical thinking that only come through active engagement. 


## What This Guide Covers
* Situations to use AI
* Situations to not use AI
* How to prompt AI effectively and ethically



## Situations to Not Use AI
 While AI is a very powerful tool that can improve your academic work, you should avoid using AI in many scenerios. For example, you could potentially run into ethical concerns using AI models to cite sources or bypass plagerism checkers. The following list will show where AI use should be avoided to uphold academic ethical values, maintain learning, and produce quality work.

###  Researching Information
One significant disadvantage of AI is accuracy. Because AI relies on massive data sets that could be inaccurate or biased, the information given could prove false. In addition, AI models such as ChatGPT are predictive models that generate responses based on predictions rather than verified fact. For example, if an AI model was given data that said "2+2=5", it would output "5" when asked "whats 2+2", because the model is predicting the output rather than actually finding the answer. AI models also consume significantly more energy, as much as 36 times that of a standard Google search, raising serious concerns about environmental impact.

### Writing Large Texts
Relying on AI to write large portions of an assignment is a serious ethical concern and violates many academic honor codes. In addition to the ethical implications, purely AI-generated text can be of low quality and won't represent a true understanding of the topic.

###  Producing Exam and Quiz Answers
Exams and quizzes are meant to evaluate the learning of the student. Using AI language models to generate exam answers undermines the integrity of the tests, showing what the AI knows rather than what the student knows.

###  Citing Sources
As stated previously, AI is a predictive model, meaning it will generate information that sounds credible but isn't necessarily credible. When asked to find sources, AI models may make up or "hallucinate" these citations and references. Using these fabricated sources will undermine the academic integrity of any paper or presentation.

 ###  Using AI to Bypass Plagiarism Checkers
Plagiarism isn't limited to copying and pasting someone's work verbatim; plagiarism also includes passing someone else's ideas off as your own. Using AI models to tweak other people's academic writings in an attempt to avoid plagiarism detectors still constitutes plagiarism and is a form of academic dishonesty.

>[!Important]
Each University and professor will have rules and guidelines on what AI use is permitted. Make sure you review all policies related to AI use and prioritize following these policies to ensure ethical use of AI.

## Conclusion: Practicing Integrity in the Age of AI

As AI continues to become more integrated into academic life, you must adapt with equal parts curiosity and responsibility. Ethical AI use isn’t just about avoiding misconduct, it’s about preserving the integrity of your learning and taking ownership of your educational journey.

By understanding where and how AI can enhance your work, and recognizing when its use crosses ethical lines, you set yourself up for success not only in your courses, but in your future career. Let AI be your assistant, not your substitute.

Remember:

Use AI to explore ideas, not to do your thinking for you.

Stay informed about your university's policies.

Prompt clearly, check sources, and engage critically.

Protect your data and avoid reinforcing bias.

Treat AI as a powerful tool — and wield it wisely.
