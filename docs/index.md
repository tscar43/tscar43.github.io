# Ethical AI Use: A User Guide
AI tools have become increasingly common in university settings. Students now have access to models that can assist with writing, research, problem-solving, and more. When used thoughtfully, these tools can enhance the learning processes. However, responsible use requires intention, honesty, and awareness.

AI should support learning, not replace it. We benefit most when we use AI to generate ideas, clarify confusing topics, or review and improve our work. Delegating entire assignments to AI undermines the purpose of education and can lead to academic integrity violations.

Many universities now maintain policies that govern the use of AI in coursework. These policies vary across departments and institutions but generally aim to preserve the integrity of student learning. Becoming familiar with these guidelines and following them closely will help you avoid unintentional misuse.

This guide outlines practical and ethical ways to integrate AI tools into your academic work. The goal is to help you benefit from what these technologies offer without sacrificing the skills and critical thinking that only come through active engagement. 


## What This Guide Covers
* Situations to use AI
* Situations to not use AI
* How to prompt AI effectively and ethically

## Situations to Use AI
AI is a powerful tool that we can use to enhance learning, boost productivity, and support creative or technical tasks. Whether you're tackling a complex assignment, trying to stay organized, or just need help understanding a difficult concept, AI can serve as a versatile companion. Below are some of the most effective ways to incorporate AI.
### Summarizing Data and Text
   - AI condenses lengthy articles, research papers, or textbook chapters into key points.
   - It extracts patterns from datasets, helping to identify trends.
   - AI tools generate summaries of lecture notes or meeting transcripts for quick review.

![AI response: AI tools are increasingly used in universities to aid writing, research, and problem-solving. When used responsibly—with honesty and intention—they can enhance learning. However, relying entirely on AI for assignments undermines education and may breach academic integrity. Universities have varying policies on AI use, so it’s important to understand and follow them. This guide promotes ethical, practical use of AI to support learning while preserving critical thinking and personal skill development.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyHUhM7Ryl.png)



### Writing Support
   - AI assists with grammar and spelling checks to improve the quality of written work.
![Prompt given to ChatGPT: "is this grammatically correct: Red is greener than purple, for sure." AI response:Yes, the sentence "Red is greener than purple, for sure." is grammatically correct.
However, it's nonsensical or humorous in meaning—since "red" and "purple" aren't typically measured on a scale of "greenness." It's often used as a tongue-in-cheek or absurdist statement, and might be intended as a joke or a play on logic.Let me know if you're using it seriously or for fun—happy to help either way!](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJyL6M7CJe.png)

   - It has the ability to help with structuring essays, generating outlines, and rewording sentences for clarity.

### Coding Help
   - AI can assist in debugging code, explaining concepts, and offering example implementations.
   - It can generate documentation with documentation for languages like markdown and help with syntax.

### Study and Revision
   - AI aides in studying as a powerful tool by summarizing lots of text/data and spitting out flashcards, quizzes or another mode of media can be very effective.
   - AI can serve as a substitute to another peer if no one is available

![Prompt given to ChatGPT:"Create flashcards for learning how many bits are in data types." AI response:Sure! Here’s a set of digital flashcards to help you learn how many bits are in common data types (typically in C/C++, Java, or similar languages). Keep in mind that the size can vary by system and language, but these are the standard/common ones:
📇 Flashcard 1
Q: How many bits are in a byte?
A: 8 bits
📇 Flashcard 2
Q: How many bits are in a char?
A: 8 bits](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BygnGP7Ayg.png)


### Explaining Concepts
   - YouTube will often better assist you in comprehending difficult concepts. AI models on the other hand have an advantage when it comes to clarifying questions on top of explaining the initial concept.

![Prompt given to ChatGPT:"Can you explain photosynthesis for me?" AI response: Absolutely! Here's a clear and simple explanation of photosynthesis:
🌱 What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight to make their own food.
☀️ How it Works (The Basics):
Plants take in:
Sunlight (from the sun)
Carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air
Water (H₂O) from the soil](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJEZGP7A1e.png)



### Other Languages
   - AI can translate text, correct grammar, and provide conversational practice in different languages.
   - It can help with pronunciation and help explain grammar in a way that a tool like google translate would not.

### Time Management and Productivity
   - AI-powered tools such as calendars can assist in scheduling, setting reminders, and managing tasks efficiently.
   - It can help prioritize assignments based on time and/or difficulty allowing you to focus on your work more.

### Brainstorming and Creativity
   - AI can help generate creative ideas for projects, stories, and presentations.
   - The results that you can get may be limited because of the nature of AI models but can be a good starting point. 

>[!Important]
While AI can be very helpful, you should always verify information from credible sources and ensure your work remains original, and follow academic integrity guidelines from your institution. AI should be used as a tool for learning, not a replacement for critical thinking.


## Situations to Not Use AI
While AI is a very powerful tool that can improve your academic work in various ways, there are several scenarios where AI use is not appropriate. The following list will show where AI use should be avoided to uphold academic ethical values, maintain learning, and produce quality work.

###  Researching Information
One significant disadvantage of AI is its accuracy. Because AI relies on massive data sets that could be inaccurate or biased, the information given could be false. In addition, AI models such as ChatGPT are predictive models that will generate responses based on predictions rather than verified facts. AI models also consume significantly more energy, as much as 36 times that of a standard Google search, raising serious concerns about environmental impact.

### Writing Large Texts
Relying on AI to write large portions of an assignment is a serious ethical concern and violates many academic honor codes. In addition to the ethical implications, purely AI-generated text can be of low quality and won't represent a true understanding of the topic.

###  Producing Exam and Quiz Answers
Exams and quizzes are meant to evaluate the learning of the student. By using AI language models to generate the answers, it undermines the integrity of the tests, showing what the AI knows rather than what the student knows.

###  Citing Sources
As stated previously, AI is a predictive model, meaning it will generate information that sounds credible but isn't accurate. When asked to find sources, AI models may make up or "hallucinate" these citations and references. Using these fabricated sources will undermine the academic integrity of any paper or presentation.

 ###  Using AI to Bypass Plagiarism Checkers
Plagiarism isn't limited to copying and pasting someone's work verbatim, plagiarism also includes passing someone else's ideas off as your own. Using AI models to tweak other people's academic writings in an attempt to avoid plagiarism detectors still constitutes plagiarism and is a form of academic dishonesty.

>[!Important]
Each University and professor will have rules and guidelines on what AI use is permitted. Make sure you review all policies related to AI use and prioritize following these policies to ensure ethical use of AI.
