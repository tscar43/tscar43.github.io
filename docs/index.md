# Ethical AI Use: A User Guide
AI tools have become increasingly common in university settings. Students now have access to models that can assist with writing, research, problem-solving, and more. When used thoughtfully, these tools can enhance the learning processes. However, responsible use requires intention, honesty, and awareness.

AI should support learning, not replace it. We benefit most when we use AI to generate ideas, clarify confusing topics, or review and improve our work. Delegating entire assignments to AI undermines the purpose of education and can lead to academic integrity violations.

Many universities now maintain policies that govern the use of AI in coursework. These policies vary across departments and institutions but generally aim to preserve the integrity of student learning. Becoming familiar with these guidelines and following them closely will help you avoid unintentional misuse.

This guide outlines practical and ethical ways to integrate AI tools into your academic work. The goal is to help you benefit from what these technologies offer without sacrificing the skills and critical thinking that only come through active engagement.

## Conclusion: Practicing Integrity in the Age of AI

As AI continues to become more integrated into academic life, you must adapt with equal parts curiosity and responsibility. Ethical AI use isn’t just about avoiding misconduct, it’s about preserving the integrity of your learning and taking ownership of your educational journey.

By understanding where and how AI can enhance your work, and recognizing when its use crosses ethical lines, you set yourself up for success not only in your courses, but in your future career. Let AI be your assistant, not your substitute.

Remember:

Use AI to explore ideas, not to do your thinking for you.

Stay informed about your university's policies.

Prompt clearly, check sources, and engage critically.

Protect your data and avoid reinforcing bias.

Treat AI as a powerful tool — and wield it wisely.
