## Situations to Use AI
AI is a powerful tool that we can use to enhance learning, boost productivity, and support creative or technical tasks. Whether you're tackling a complex assignment, trying to stay organized, or just need help understanding a difficult concept, AI can serve as a versatile companion. Below are some of the most effective ways to incorporate AI.
### Summarizing Data and Text
   - AI condenses lengthy articles, research papers, or textbook chapters into key points.
   - It extracts patterns from datasets, helping to identify trends.
   - AI tools generate summaries of lecture notes or meeting transcripts for quick review.

![AI response: AI tools are increasingly used in universities to aid writing, research, and problem-solving. When used responsibly‚Äîwith honesty and intention‚Äîthey can enhance learning. However, relying entirely on AI for assignments undermines education and may breach academic integrity. Universities have varying policies on AI use, so it‚Äôs important to understand and follow them. This guide promotes ethical, practical use of AI to support learning while preserving critical thinking and personal skill development.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyHUhM7Ryl.png)



### Writing Support
   - AI assists with grammar and spelling checks to improve the quality of written work.
![Prompt given to ChatGPT: "is this grammatically correct: Red is greener than purple, for sure." AI response:Yes, the sentence "Red is greener than purple, for sure." is grammatically correct.
However, it's nonsensical or humorous in meaning‚Äîsince "red" and "purple" aren't typically measured on a scale of "greenness." It's often used as a tongue-in-cheek or absurdist statement, and might be intended as a joke or a play on logic.Let me know if you're using it seriously or for fun‚Äîhappy to help either way!](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJyL6M7CJe.png)

   - It has the ability to help with structuring essays, generating outlines, and rewording sentences for clarity.

### Coding Help

   - It can generate documentation with documentation for languages like markdown and help with syntax.

### Study and Revision
   - AI aides in studying as a powerful tool by summarizing lots of text/data and spitting out flashcards, quizzes or another mode of media can be very effective.
   - AI can serve as a substitute to another peer if no one is available

![Prompt given to ChatGPT:"Create flashcards for learning how many bits are in data types." AI response:Sure! Here‚Äôs a set of digital flashcards to help you learn how many bits are in common data types (typically in C/C++, Java, or similar languages). Keep in mind that the size can vary by system and language, but these are the standard/common ones:
üìá Flashcard 1
Q: How many bits are in a byte?
A: 8 bits
üìá Flashcard 2
Q: How many bits are in a char?
A: 8 bits](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BygnGP7Ayg.png)


### Explaining Concepts
   - YouTube will often better assist you in comprehending difficult concepts. AI models on the other hand have an advantage when it comes to clarifying questions on top of explaining the initial concept.

![Prompt given to ChatGPT:"Can you explain photosynthesis for me?" AI response: Absolutely! Here's a clear and simple explanation of photosynthesis:
üå± What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight to make their own food.
‚òÄÔ∏è How it Works (The Basics):
Plants take in:
Sunlight (from the sun)
Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) from the air
Water (H‚ÇÇO) from the soil](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJEZGP7A1e.png)



### Other Languages

    While AI can be very helpful, you should always verify information from credible sources and ensure your work remains original, and follow academic integrity guidelines from your institution. AI should be used as a tool for learning, not a replacement for critical thinking.
