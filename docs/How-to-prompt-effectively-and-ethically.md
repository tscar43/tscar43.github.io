## Prompting AI Effectively and Ethically

Prompting AI is a large part of using AI effectively and ethically. Good prompt writing helps the AI produce more accurate and comprehensive answers.

### Effective Prompt Writing

#### 1. Providing Context

Giving context in your prompts to the AI assists the AI by giving it more parameters to work with. The AI will provide a more in depth answer based on the context of your problem compared to a simpler prompt.

!!! tip

    Asking the AI to take on a character or voice is also an effective strategy in prompt writing

Let's take a look at some different prompts

!!! example

    Give me some book recommendations

This super vague prompt offers very little context to the AI, which will result in the AI not giving a very good answer.

!!! example

    Give me some historical fiction book recommendations that are no longer than 200 pages in length and contain a female main character
    
This prompt is definitely better than the last one, and will yield some good answers, but it can still be improved.

!!! example

    Give me some historical fiction book recommendations that are no longer than 200 pages in length, contain a female main character, and was written 20th century America. Also, explain these book recommendations like a passionate English professor at a top university.
    
This is an excellent prompt! It gives the AI lots of context for the question and utilizes the AI's ability to take on a role in order to create a better, more comprehensive answer.

#### 2. Being Specific

Creating specific prompts goes hand-in-hand with giving context to your prompts. Imposing a specific task, rules, and constraints on the AI will help direct its focus to the topic you want it to generate responses about.

!!! note

    You'll notice that in our final example from last section that we provided the AI with a specific time period and location. This is a good example of creating specificity in your prompts.

Here's a good example of a specific prompt:

!!! example

    I'm interested in learning more about jazz history. Can you give me examples of jazz artists that influenced the spread of the Harlem Renaissance in 1920's Harlem, New York?</span>
    
This prompt is a good example of how good prompt writing can help you as a student in your studies. It gives a specific time period, location, and topic.

#### 3. Continuing the Conversation

You can iron out any wrinkles in your AI's responses by continuing to talk with the AI. You do not need to repeat any context given, but you can follow up with prompts such as "now explain it to a kindergartener" or "make the response only 3 sentences long".
!!! tip

    Adding too many prompts may start to obstruct the AI's responses, especially if you switch topics. At this point, it is best to start a new chat.

### Ethical Prompt Writing

#### 1. Protecting Your Data

You should always avoid sharing sensitive information and data about yourself and others to publicly accessible AI platforms. Examples of information you should avoid sharing include:

* Names
* Addresses (both physical and email)
* Identification numbers
* Medical, HR, and Financial Records
* Company/Research Data that is not available to the public

Many publicly available AI tools learn from the data that its users input. This means that your sensitive data could be used for training or appear in future outputs from the AI.

#### 2. Bias in Prompt Writing

Biased prompts can influence the AI to reinforce harmful biases and misinformation. These prompts are very easy to create unintentionally, leading towards a harmful stereotype that can skew the responses given by the AI.

!!! example

    Why are students from community colleges less prepared for engineering programs?</span>
    
This prompt assumes that transfer students from community colleges are already less prepared than a student who attended a 4-year university from the start of their college career. This shows how a prompt that contains a harmful bias will affect how the AI responds to the prompt.

This prompt can be fixed by rephrasing it as:

"What barriers might students from community colleges face when transferring to engineering programs at four-year universities, and how can those be addressed?"

This prompt avoids bias and frames the question in a way that supports community college transfer students.

    Be sure to consult your own university's policies on generative AI use to ensure that you are using AI ethically.
