## Situations to Not Use AI
 While AI is a very powerful tool that can improve your academic work, you should avoid using AI in many scenerios. For example, you could potentially run into ethical concerns using AI models to cite sources or bypass plagerism checkers. The following list will show where AI use should be avoided to uphold academic ethical values, maintain learning, and produce quality work.

###  Researching Information
One significant disadvantage of AI is accuracy. Because AI relies on massive data sets that could be inaccurate or biased, the information given could prove false. In addition, AI models such as ChatGPT are predictive models that generate responses based on predictions rather than verified fact. For example, if an AI model was given data that said "2+2=5", it would output "5" when asked "whats 2+2", because the model is predicting the output rather than actually finding the answer. AI models also consume significantly more energy, as much as 36 times that of a standard Google search, raising serious concerns about environmental impact.

### Writing Large Texts
Relying on AI to write large portions of an assignment is a serious ethical concern and violates many academic honor codes. In addition to the ethical implications, purely AI-generated text can be of low quality and won't represent a true understanding of the topic.

      When prompted to write a 5 page essay on the novel Orbital by Samantha Harvey, part of ChatGPT's response is: 

      "This physical perspective also enables a more introspective form of thought. The astronauts are suspended above the Earth, removed from the everyday noise and obligations of terrestrial life. In that silence, their thoughts turn inward. The narrative glides seamlessly from one character’s stream of consciousness to another, creating a collage of interiority. These reflections are often deeply personal and rooted in memory. One astronaut, a father, watches the UK pass beneath him and thinks of his daughter’s illness. Another reflects on war and loss. The silence of space becomes an amplifier for their inner worlds. Just as Earth appears unified from above, their thoughts, too, begin to echo one another. Though they are from different backgrounds and cultures, the astronauts all circle similar emotional themes: regret, longing, uncertainty, and hope. Harvey uses this narrative structure to suggest that beneath the surface of individuality lies a shared emotional terrain. The orbit becomes a metaphor not just for their physical path, but for the way humans continually revisit the same emotional landmarks in their own lives."

      ChatGPT's response lacks the depth that many good analyses have. It does not cite quotes or even name the characters within the novel. The overall response is very surface level and does not reflect a deep understanding of the text.

###  Producing Exam and Quiz Answers
Exams and quizzes are meant to evaluate the learning of the student. Using AI language models to generate exam answers undermines the integrity of the tests, showing what the AI knows rather than what the student knows.

###  Citing Sources
As stated previously, AI is a predictive model, meaning it will generate information that sounds credible but isn't necessarily credible. When asked to find sources, AI models may make up or "hallucinate" these citations and references. Using these fabricated sources will undermine the academic integrity of any paper or presentation.

###  Using AI to Bypass Plagiarism Checkers
Plagiarism isn't limited to copying and pasting someone's work verbatim; plagiarism also includes passing someone else's ideas off as your own. Using AI models to tweak other people's academic writings in an attempt to avoid plagiarism detectors still constitutes plagiarism and is a form of academic dishonesty.

      Each University and professor will have rules and guidelines on what AI use is permitted. Make sure you review all policies related to AI use and prioritize following these policies to ensure ethical use of AI.
