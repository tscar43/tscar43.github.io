Students now have access to models that can assist with writing, research, problem-solving, and more. When used thoughtfully, these tools can enhance the learning processes. However, responsible use requires intention, honesty, and awareness.</p> <p>AI should support learning, not replace it. We benefit most when we use AI to generate ideas, clarify confusing topics, or review and improve our work. Delegating entire assignments to AI undermines the purpose of education and can lead to academic integrity violations.</p> <p>Many universities now maintain policies that govern the use of AI in coursework. These policies vary across departments and institutions but generally aim to preserve the integrity of student learning. Becoming familiar with these guidelines and following them closely will help you avoid unintentional misuse.</p> <p>This guide outlines practical and ethical ways to integrate AI tools into your academic work. The goal is to help you benefit from what these technologies offer without sacrificing the skills and critical thinking that only come through active engagement. </p>"},{"location":"#what-this-guide-covers","title":"What This Guide Covers","text":"<ul> <li>Situations to use AI</li> <li>Situations to not use AI</li> <li>How to prompt AI effectively and ethically</li> </ul>"},{"location":"How-to-Prompt-Effectively-And-Ethically/","title":"How to Prompt Effectively And Ethically","text":""},{"location":"How-to-Prompt-Effectively-And-Ethically/#prompting-ai-effectively-and-ethically","title":"Prompting AI Effectively and Ethically","text":"<p>Prompting AI is a large part of using AI effectively and ethically.

This is a good example of creating specificity in your prompts.</p> <p>Here's a good example of a specific prompt:</p> <p>Example</p> <p>I'm interested in learning more about jazz history. Can you give me examples of jazz artists that influenced the spread of the Harlem Renaissance in 1920's Harlem, New York?</p> <p>This prompt is a good example of how good prompt writing can help you as a student in your studies.

Because AI relies on massive data sets that could be inaccurate or biased, the information given could prove false. In addition, AI models such as ChatGPT are predictive models that generate responses based on predictions rather than verified fact. For example, if an AI model was given data that said \"2+2=5\", it would output \"5\" when asked \"whats 2+2\", because the model is predicting the output rather than actually finding the answer. AI models also consume significantly more energy, as much as 36 times that of a standard Google search, raising serious concerns about environmental impact.</p>"},{"location":"Situations-To-Not-Use-AI/#writing-large-texts","title":"Writing Large Texts","text":"<p>Relying on AI to write large portions of an assignment is a serious ethical concern and violates many academic honor codes. In addition to the ethical implications, purely AI-generated text can be of low quality and won't represent a true understanding of the topic.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>When prompted to write a 5 page essay on the novel Orbital by Samantha Harvey, part of ChatGPT's response is: </p> <p>\"This physical perspective also enables a more introspective form of thought. The astronauts are suspended above the Earth, removed from the everyday noise and obligations of terrestrial life. In that silence, their thoughts turn inward. The narrative glides seamlessly from one character\u2019s stream of consciousness to another, creating a collage of interiority. These reflections are often deeply personal and rooted in memory. One astronaut, a father, watches the UK pass beneath him and thinks of his daughter\u2019s illness. Another reflects on war and loss. The silence of space becomes an amplifier for their inner worlds. Just as Earth appears unified from above, their thoughts, too, begin to echo one another. Though they are from different backgrounds and cultures, the astronauts all circle similar emotional themes: regret, longing, uncertainty, and hope. Harvey uses this narrative structure to suggest that beneath the surface of individuality lies a shared emotional terrain. The orbit becomes a metaphor not just for their physical path, but for the way humans continually revisit the same emotional landmarks in their own lives.\"</p> <p>ChatGPT's response lacks the depth that many good analyses have. It does not cite quotes or even name the characters within the novel. The overall response is very surface level and does not reflect a deep understanding of the text.</p>"},{"location":"Situations-To-Not-Use-AI/#producing-exam-and-quiz-answers","title":"Producing Exam and Quiz Answers","text":"<p>Exams and quizzes are meant to evaluate the learning of the student.
