Students now have access to models that can assist with writing, research, problem-solving, and more. When used thoughtfully, these tools can enhance the learning processes. However, responsible use requires intention, honesty, and awareness.</p> <p>AI should support learning, not replace it. We benefit most when we use AI to generate ideas, clarify confusing topics, or review and improve our work. Delegating entire assignments to AI undermines the purpose of education and can lead to academic integrity violations.</p> <p>Many universities now maintain policies that govern the use of AI in coursework. These policies vary across departments and institutions but generally aim to preserve the integrity of student learning. Becoming familiar with these guidelines and following them closely will help you avoid unintentional misuse.</p> <p>This guide outlines practical and ethical ways to integrate AI tools into your academic work. The goal is to help you benefit from what these technologies offer without sacrificing the skills and critical thinking that only come through active engagement. </p>"},{"location":"#what-is-covered","title":"What is covered","text":"<ul> <li>Situations to use AI</li> <li>Situations to not use AI</li> <li>How to prompt effectively and ethically</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#situations-to-use-ai","title":"Situations to Use AI","text":"<p>AI is a powerful tool that we can use to enhance learning, boost productivity, and support creative or technical tasks.

The following list will show where AI use should be avoided to uphold academic ethical values, maintain learning, and produce quality work.</p>"},{"location":"#researching-information","title":"Researching Information","text":"<p>One significant disadvantage of AI is its accuracy. Because AI relies on massive data sets that could be inaccurate or biased, the information given could be false. In addition, AI models such as ChatGPT are predictive models that will generate responses based on predictions rather than verified facts. AI models also consume significantly more energy, as much as 36 times that of a standard Google search, raising serious concerns about environmental impact.</p>"},{"location":"#writing-large-texts","title":"Writing Large Texts","text":"<p>Relying on AI to write large portions of an assignment is a serious ethical concern and violates many academic honor codes.

When asked to find sources, AI models may make up or \"hallucinate\" these citations and references. Using these fabricated sources will undermine the academic integrity of any paper or presentation.</p> <p>###  Using AI to Bypass Plagiarism Checkers Plagiarism isn't limited to copying and pasting someone's work verbatim, plagiarism also includes passing someone else's ideas off as your own. Using AI models to tweak other people's academic writings in an attempt to avoid plagiarism detectors still constitutes plagiarism and is a form of academic dishonesty.</p> <p>[!Important] Each University and professor will have rules and guidelines on what AI use is permitted. Make sure you review all policies related to AI use and prioritize following these policies to ensure ethical use of AI.</p>"},{"location":"#prompting-ai-effectively-and-ethically","title":"Prompting AI Effectively and Ethically","text":"<p>Prompting AI is a large part of using AI effectively and ethically.

Providing Context","text":"<p>Giving context in your prompts to the AI assists the AI by giving it more parameters to work with. The AI will provide a more in depth answer based on the context of your problem compared to a simpler prompt. </p> <p>[!TIP] Asking the AI to take on a character or voice is also an effective strategy in prompt writing</p> <p>Let's take a look at some different prompts</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Give me some book recommendations <p>This prompt is super vague and offers very little context to the AI, which will result in the AI not giving a very good answer.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Give me some historical fiction book recommendations that are no longer than 200 pages in length and contain a female main character</p> <p>This prompt is definitely better than the last one, and will yield some good answers, but it can still be improved.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Give me some historical fiction book recommendations that are no longer than 200 pages in length, contain a female main character, and was written 20th century America. Also, explain these book recommendations like a passionate English professor at a top university.</p> <p>This is an excellent prompt! It gives the AI lots of context for the question and utilizes the AI's ability to take on a role in order to create a better, more comprehensive answer.</p>"},{"location":"#2-being-specific","title":"2. Being Specific","text":"<p>Creating specific prompts goes hand-in-hand with giving context to your prompts. Imposing a specific task, rules, and constraints on the AI will help direct its focus to the topic you want it to generate responses about.</p> <p>[!NOTE] You'll notice that in our final example from last section that we provided the AI with a specific time period and location. This is a good example of creating specificity in your prompts.</p> <p>Here's a good example of a specific prompt:</p> <p>I'm interested in learning more about jazz history. Can you give me examples of jazz artists that influenced the spread of the Harlem Renaissance in 1920's Harlem, New York?</p> <p>This prompt is a good example of how good prompt writing can help you as a student in your studies. It gives a specific time period, location, and topic.</p>"},{"location":"#3-continuing-the-conversation","title":"3. Continuing the Conversation","text":"<p>You can iron out any wrinkles in your AI's responses by continuing to talk with the AI. You do not need to repeat any context given, but you can follow up with prompts such as \"now explain it to a kindergartener\" or \"make the response only 3 sentences long\".</p> <p>[!TIP] Adding too many prompts may start to obstruct the AI's responses, especially if you switch topics. At this point, it is best to start a new chat.</p> <p>For more information on effective prompting, see Harvard University's guide on generative AI prompts.</p>"},{"location":"#ethical-prompt-writing","title":"Ethical Prompt Writing","text":""},{"location":"#1-protecting-your-data","title":"1.

Bias in Prompt Writing","text":"<p>Biased prompts can influence the AI to reinforce harmful biases and misinformation. It is very easy to unintentionally create prompts that lead towards a harmful stereotype that can skew the responses given by the AI.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Why are students from community colleges less prepared for engineering programs?</p> <p>This prompt assumes that transfer students from community colleges are already less prepared than a student who attended a 4 year university from the start of their college career. This is an example of a prompt that contains a harmful bias that will affect how the AI responds to the prompt.</p> <p>This prompt can be fixed by rephrasing it as:</p> <p>What barriers might students from community colleges face when transferring to engineering programs at four-year universities, and how can those be addressed?</p> <p>This prompt avoids bias and frames the question in a way that supports community college transfer students. </p> <p>Further information on ethical prompt writing is available on Arkansas State University's guide to using AI in academic settings.</p>"}]}
